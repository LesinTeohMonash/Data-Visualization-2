                <p>If you want to check the emission of certain food, simply click on the "Food Selection" tab and choose the food that you after.</p>
                <p>Observe these four line charts, it is obvious that beef, lamb, milk and food which are non vegan produce higher emission.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, plant based food always produce less emission.</p>
                <p>From these graphs, we only know which food produce more or less emission compared to other foods.</p>
                <p>However, there is no clue to the factors and reasons to what cause the food emission vary to the types of foods. </p>

                <p>From the pie charts above, we know that dairy milk produce higher emission to the environment.</p>

                <p>From the bar chart, we know the impact that brought by the dairy milk is the most compared to other types of milk.</p>

            <div class="pure-u-1-2">
                <p>The type of milk that leads the least impact to the environment is soy milk and it is strongly recommended to consume any plant-based milk instead of dairy milk.</p>
                <p>To see less types of milk, press the label on the right of the pie charts and bar chart. </p>

                <p>For instance, if a food is produced from Australia but exported to Africa, the food emission goes under Australia.</p>
                <p>The share here means the percentage of the food which produce n percentage over the total food for each country.</p>
                <p>For example, Australia produces n amount of food, while 10% of of them producing food emission. The share of food emission in Australia is 10%</p>

                <p>It is obvious the Brazil produces the highest amount of food emission compared to other countries in the list.</p>
                <p>The amount of food emission produced by Australia is not as high as Brazil and China, instead, Australia only produces not greater than 1.2 percent of food emission.</p>
